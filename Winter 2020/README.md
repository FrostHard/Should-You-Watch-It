#### Banjo’s Perspective

***Drop It***

Kaname Sudou is your average high-school student, toiling away in life with his best buds. One day, however, he receives a mysterious invitation to use an app on his smart phone, and, upon accepting, finds himself thrust into an augmented reality where superpowers exist, riches implode, and death glooms overhead. Coined *Darwin’s Game*, this survival-of-the-fittest situation demands everything – but supplies almost nothing in return.

The first episode is a double-feature, but it only serves to stab home the point that this anime has a difficult time outrunning its tired premises and eye-rolling events. Motivations are bland. Outcomes have little consequential value. Themes take a backseat to uninteresting dialogue. Alongside the lackluster duels and the inevitable overseers, the storytelling has thus far been a keen recipe for trite dealings.

A lack of meta details and necessary explanations seek to create an air of mystery to the whole debacle, yet this direction exacerbates the show’s problems. I.e., this no knowledge is no good, for the implausibility and the irrationality of the decisions and the confrontations equates to suspended disbelief that drags down the evolution of its natural selection.

“I wasn’t too hopeful going into the show, death game shows are generally hard to pull off due to the large cast and limited run time. Darwin’s Game attempts to tackle this issue by focusing on only a few characters.

Normally you’d think that’s a good thing, but if anything it’s to the shows detriment in this case, as there’s not a single interesting character in the show. Thus far out of all the named characters, only two of them has been developed to the point where I can even call them one-dimensional. And I’d be damned if they’re not some impressively one-dimensional characters.

We're stuck with an extremely bland insert protagonist, wiith the few traits he has actually affecting his character negatively and a heroine who looks good, but out of place in this show.

Speaking of visuals, the fight choreography is really boring and the animation and art style is nothing special at all so we end up with mediocrity in that regard.

If I am to be honest, the show has so many faults, I can begin to cover them all and it'd only be worth watching as a hate watch or as popcorn material with your mates. There's probably a good 20-30 shows better than Darwin's Game from this season, so just don't watch i unless you're really bored.”

(English Title: *Keep Your Hands Off Eizouken!*)
#### Banjo’s Perspective

***Must Watch It***

Anime is life. At least, that seems to be the case for Midori Asakusa of *Eizouken ni wa Te wo Dasu na!*. She dreams of making anime, drawing out sketches and ideas based on her own favorite elements and the avant-garde city where she lives. With help from her money-hungry best friend Sayaka Kanamori and their newfound comrade Tsubame Mizusaki, these three ladies embark on a journey to truly define art, animation, and ultimately anime.

And they certainly go the distance. Above anything else, this anime personifies its namesake, creating elaborate sequences, stylized imaginings, and incredible moments that shape it into a juggernaut of visual awe. The fun musical choices complement the passion therein, yet it’s the self-made sound-effects from the voice actresses themselves that instill a personalized feel into the engaging wonders.

To put devil’s advocate in motion, a rather loose plot and possible pigeonholing for the main trio raise the tiniest of flags. Nevertheless, to return the other way, its overall *potential* is clearly there anyway as the open-ended nature of its storytelling and the grounded realism of the characters prove it has inherent writing chops. With meta inclusions of drawing techniques and the fact that the comedic pieces land upright, and this anime becomes worthy of several high-fives.

#### Another Perspective, courtesy of /u/meiiro:

***Must Watch It***

“From first glance, “Keep Your Hands Off Of Eizouken!” may look like your typical high school girl comedy. However, it’s much more than that; Eizouken is a quirky, imaginative look into the world of animation and people following their passions. It follows three distinctly different girls, each with their own fleshed out personalities and aspirations, on their journey to creating anime together.

The most enjoyable thing about Eizouken is that it’s never afraid to blur reality and fiction together. Each brainstorming session transforms into a fantastical journey. Figuring out how a windmill moves turns into a dynamic animation sequence with explosions and all new inventions. Even more than its random ventures into fantasy, the setting of Eizouken is its own breed of interesting. A faculty room in a pool, a clock on a school the students can’t even see- there’s so much to unpack, and it never gets boring.

These settings only serve to enhance the true stars, the characters. The dynamic between the main trio is nothing short of amazing; each personality is designed to compliment and contrast the other. More than that, the cast is already fleshed out and realistic; there’s no such thing as being two-dimensional from the very get-go.

Overall, Eizouken is an enjoyable watch, down-to-earth in plot and outside the box in presentation. Many have described it to be in the same genre as Shirobako - a sincere love letter to anime. If there’s one show you don’t want to miss this season, it’s Eizouken.

## [**ID: Invaded**](https://myanimelist.net/anime/40046/ID_Invaded)
![](https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1954/104672l.jpg)
#### Banjo’s Perspective

***Watch It***

What do you get when you take the future-crime aspect of *Minority Report*, the mind-delving craziness of *Inception*, and the persuasive psychosis of *Silence of the Lambs*? The answer is *ID: Invaded*.

An original (that is, non-source adaptation) story, this anime has started for itself an intriguing crime thriller in most regards. The show balances its time between the detective work of its central protagonist and the informants who analyze his findings. What transpires, then, is a cool duality whose simultaneous weirdness and realness melds together in a very neat way.

Moreover, the anime is keen on exploring the important members of its cast and the wild setting it has created. Intentional parallels across plotlines and the blurring of lines between the “heroes” and the “villains” further pushes the story and the characters to higher levels.

The artistic vision for this show isn’t anything too special, so there does exist room for improvement. But this early on, the predictions and discoveries of its identity should hopefully be a satisfying endeavor.

#### Another Perspective, courtesy of /u/Nazenn:

***Drop It***

“With obvious world similarities to Psycho-Pass and an intriguing main character, ID:Invaded had all the pieces needed to be the next big sci-fi crime mystery, but it spends far too much of its runtime focusing on its bloated side cast and repetitive exposition.

Any moment we’re not following the MC characters investigations in a criminal’s mindscape, we’re usually stuck sitting in a room listening to generic “investigators” talk at each other, using lifeless dialogue that doesn’t showcase any of their individual personalities. One character will say something, another will repeat it back to them as a question, only for the next character to repeat it again in a different way. If they’re not using techno-babble to explaining the details of the machine in excruciating detail irrelevant to the current drama going on, they’re narrating everything that’s happening on screen to the level of allowing the show to be more of an audiobook.

While the MC’s investigations and history are very interesting, they also fall victim to this over-exposition the moment we return to the investigators. It strips away a lot of the mystery when are made to listen rather than watch, having the show tell you what does and doesn’t matter. If the show cut this excess and focused purely on the three interesting characters it would be a different story, but with its current structure it makes it hard to recommend unless you want feel like you’re being talked at for 20 minutes each week.”

#### Banjo’s Perspective

***Drop It***

Sometime in the future, true virtual reality has become a norm for most gamers. Reiji Mukudori, interested in such a place, decides to make his own character within such a VRMMO video game: *Infinite Dendrogram*. Unlike traditional MMOs, however, this adventure has left excitement behind.

The key motif of this story comes from the understood notion that this VR world is organic and alive. Sadly, that’s the extent of the anime, for the unfortunate reality is instead that the surrounding parts are devoid of the same fortitude. The main character, his “maid”, and the supporting cast are largely forgettable. The story beats have been totally ineffective. The attempts at incorporating the gaming side of things are meager at best.

It goes on. The anime doesn’t seem up to the challenge of asking – let alone answering – the moral and the societal questions that their literal realistic fantasy entails. Not to mention that, on an artistic front, the show shows weak signs already. When all is said and done, the scope and the impact of this project is not just finite but practically zero.

#### Another Perspective, courtesy of /u/porpoiseoflife:

***Consider It***

“I can hear the detractors now. *Yadda yadda SAO clone yadda yadda loli sidekick yadda yadda kuma yadda yadda drop*. What these sweeping generalizations miss is that this show is actually a fun thing to watch. The fight animation has been great, the details of the world are wonderful, and the main characters are nicely done yet without the incessant edgelord mentality that is far too common in the VRMMO subgenre.

You know that they are playing a game for the sake of playing a game, without any need for grand stakes or heavy consequences. And oh boy, does that game look like fun. A sandbox environment where the characters can change the game world significantly would be on my top list of things to try out, the concept of fully AI driven NPCs is fascinating, and the little hints about the greater gameworld makes me wish that full-dive technology was a real thing so I could waste my free time playing it.

For fans of the VRMMO subgenre, this should be promoted to Watch status. For everyone else, consider this as an alternative to the others languishing in your drop lists.”

## [**Ishuzoku Reviewers**](https://myanimelist.net/anime/40010/Ishuzoku_Reviewers)

(English Title: *Interspecies Reviewers*)
![](https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1877/104025l.jpg)
#### Banjo’s Perspective

***Consider It***

From humans to elves, demons to beasts, and any other manner of creature in-between, *Ishuzoku Reviewers* stars a plethora of species-specific humanoids. But it’s not quite that tame. Oh no. In fact, it’s the complete opposite, for *this* anime focuses on the one inherent quality that drives biology: sex.

Stunk, Zel, and Crim make it their mission to critique these sexual encounters, describing their likes and dislikes which culminate in that all-important climactic score. In doing so, the anime thrusts with vigor in different ways. The comedy angle keeps the content lighthearted throughout. The emphasis on being sex-positive aligns with the ecchi genre. And the scenes may as well be deemed pornography for just how much they are willing to depict (especially so in the uncensored version).

Ironically enough, though, the diversity within the anime is also its downfall. Catering to everyone and everything means that, amidst the laughs and the sexiness, the weird and the nasty inevitably materialize. Indeed, needing to endure such moments is arguably not justifiable in the long run.

If nothing else, the project has some nice production values, and the sex shows no signs of stopping its upward debauchery. So, for now, its final review must wait.

#### Another Perspective, courtesy of /u/Dagonsnake:

***Consider It***

“Ishuzoku Reviewers is certainly a unique show, the entire premise is simple, two guys want to have sex with as many different creatures in their fantasy world as possible, and after they sex up their local brothels, they write a review about their experience with said species, and give it a rating from 1-10.

The art is pretty good, and the character design is honestly pretty great from what I've seen so far. Every species has its own unique traits, and no two species that I've seen really look too similar. On top of this, the show probably has one of my favorite OPs of the season, and the ED isn't bad either.

The show, as you'd expect, is very fanservice heavy, there are a few scenes that are honestly, just hentai, so if you're not into that, I'd definitely recommend staying away from this show. However, if you're looking for an ecchi heavy show, or you don't mind ecchi, this show may just be for you since the humor in the show itself can honestly be pretty hilarious!

However, one final point I unfortunately feel I need to make since the show is an ecchi after all. If you're the type of person who prefers small or medium breasts, you might be somewhat disappointed as thus far the show has been pretty lacking in that regard.”

(English Title: *BOFURI: I Don’t Want to Get Hurt, so I’ll Max Out My Defense.*)
![](https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1438/105344l.jpg)
#### Banjo’s Perspective

***Watch It***

As the other major VRMMO offering of the season, *Bofuri* follows Maple, a young lady taking part in her first-ever online gaming experience. Like any normal human, she hates pain, and so she stacks points into her defense stat. Then more defense. Then even more defense. So much defense that her build becomes an anomaly worthy of this story.

This anime channels cuteness as Maple stumbles into upgrades, skirmishes, and interactions, causing a lot of hilarity and smiles as a result. Her best friend Sally contrasts her both in personality and skills; their buddy duo makes for a wholesome relationship. And the extra side details – such as the variety of enemies, the forums, the admin patches, and so on – solidly round out the underlying game setting.

The story and the characters seem content with where they’re at, so they’ll most likely not go anywhere too deep or too compelling, missing out on that worthwhile status. But when the action segments impress and the docile moments delight regardless of those factors, the project stacks its own defense in the form of above-average execution.

#### Another Perspective, courtesy of /u/Daniel_Is_I:

***Drop It***

“*Bofuri* ticks all the boxes you expect from an isekai/VRMMO show centered on an overpowered protagonist: light comedy, action, cute girls, etc. Unfortunately, ticking boxes is all it does, and it does so to the detriment of any potential it may have offered.

The premise can be grasped entirely from the title. Maple, airhead and VRMMO newbie, dumps her points into vitality and stumbles into the most broken build New World Online has ever seen. In theory, this gimmick has merit; an unkillable protagonist with no offense bumbling through combat could be interesting. This gimmick is also immediately undermined when the world starts bending over backwards to make sure Maple never experiences any struggles whatsoever. Virtually all problems are immediately resolved, often through sheer luck. Maple and co. are blessed with plot armor and play by different rules.

Perhaps the saddest thing about *Bofuri* is that nothing about it is egregious (except the game design), but nothing stands out, either. The world is a bog-standard fantasy VRMMO. The comedy is inoffensive, hardly eliciting a chuckle. There have been two strong action sequences, but they're sandwiched between long segments with little of interest happening. It's relaxed, but it's also utterly forgettable and requires no engagement from the viewer. Even worse, it's brainless, and thinking in-depth just makes its flaws stand out more.

I can understand why some might enjoy *Bofuri*, but I see no reason to watch it over the myriad of other shows it's competing with.”

## [**Jibaku Shounen Hanako-kun**](https://myanimelist.net/anime/39534/Jibaku_Shounen_Hanako-kun)

(English Title: *Toilet-bound Hanako-kun*)
![](https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1700/104788l.jpg)
#### Banjo’s Perspective

***Consider It***

At her school, Nene Yashiro hears about one of the seven mystical wonders haunting their building. She goes to an out-of-the-way bathroom, knocks on the stall, and meets Hanako-kun, the wish-giving spirit who maintains order between their two separate realms. For better or for worse, they now help each other, giving *Toilet-bound Hanako-kun* its origin.

What this show boasts most is a wonderful sense of artistry. Actual animation trends towards the low side, sure, but the shot-for-shot visuals make up for this lack and then some. Vibrant colors. Great use of lighting. Changing styles. Paneled compositions for flair. Nice designs. The anime is definitely one of the best-looking offerings this season.

Otherwise, there’s not much else to boast about. Its sense of comedy and cuteness isn’t the greatest. Its “monster-of-the-week” approach has yet to tie in well with a supposed central throughput. And the characters themselves are uninspired.

It also has a (strangely enough) unheard of problem in this medium: incorrect audio tuning. More specifically, the gain on the microphones used by the voice actors and actresses is so high, one can hear the humming feedback during quiet scenes (which are surprisingly common), breaking immersion and demonstrating an obvious misstep in execution.

Again, however, the art alone prevents the entire project from being flushed down the toilet.

#### Another Perspective, courtesy of /u/ZBLongLadder:

***Must Watch It***

“If you’ve watched much anime set in high schools, you’ve probably encountered the “Seven Wonders” trope: a set of seven urban legends the students will use to creep each other out. *Hanako-kun* gives that trope a clever twist, being set in a school where those rumors are *true* and supernatural beings from the oddly specific and morbid minds of teenagers really do haunt the halls of the school, ranging from the inconvenient to the deadly.

The show is a creepy comedy, sort of in the vein of *Nightmare Before Christmas*, and while it never fails to deliver a (mostly) lighthearted tone and plenty of laughs, it also provides a wonderfully atmospheric setting and plenty of odd and uncanny moments. This is particularly noticeable in the design of the main character, Nene, who manages to be intensely moe while also being clearly a bit unsettling, with her ever-present skull brooch, green-tipped hair, and doll-like eyes that are a bit strange even for an anime character. The characters have great chemistry, particularly between Hanako-kun and Nene, the two leads.

The art in particular is excellent, with a subdued pallet and more stylized designs giving the show a storybook-like feel. The show as a whole has an almost otherworldly quality to it, especially in the old building, where most of the apparitions seem to originate.

In all, I have been thoroughly enjoying the show, and I highly recommend it to anyone who likes comedy with a dash of creepiness.”

(English Title: *Asteroid in Love*)
![](https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1191/104212l.jpg)
#### Banjo’s Perspective

***Consider It***

Mira Konohata has a fondness for space and the galactic. Her love of the above sees her joining her school’s astronomy-turned-Earth-sciences club where she meets a bunch of likeminded girls. As a group, they aim to learn about the stars, the rocks, and the bonds they share sandwiched by these halves.

Credit where credit is due, the vibe of the anime vies for realism. Rather than injecting absurdist comedy or over-the-top silliness, the events and the mood at large stay normalized. It isn’t so much flat as it is natural, letting the cute bits and the fun reactions have a subtler delivery. Plus, while the setting is arguably a tad lame, the fluid animation does not go unnoticed for the CGDCT show.

However, it’s probably more accurate to call it “CG---" because it has effectively dropped the “DCT”. Despite the premises, where the anime is supposed to be about the study of space and the research into geology, the content often distracts itself. Granted, they work towards fleshing out the characters, so they aren’t completely meaningless, but the reasoning for telling this tale and consequently the flight of this asteroid is flimsy at best.

#### Another Perspective, courtesy of /u/SpareUmbrella:

***Must Watch It***

“This show is, essentially, a cute girls show, but this time it's an Astronomy/Geology club. There's a diverse cast of characters, cute in their own ways, but not overly saccharine like *GochiUsa* can be.

One of the things that often plagues cute girl shows is the reliance on characters explicitly calling attention to something zany another character has done. *Koisuru Asteroid* seems to largely avoid this pitfall. It's not what I'd consider laugh out loud funny, but I believe it's trying to balance its more kooky jokes and gags with more endearing character moments sometimes glazed with yuri undertones, and having seen the first 3 episodes, I feel it's done an excellent job of this so far.

That's not to say *Asteroid* doesn't have elements that feel obligatory for shows of this type, episode 2 features a bath-house scene for instance (because of course it does) however even that is used to actually weave dialogue into the show - dialogue directly relevant to both the situation the characters are in and the overall subject matter of the story.

Much like Doga Kobo's previous work (*New Game!* in particular, which has a very similar artstyle to *Asteroid*) the colour palette is bright and inviting and the girls in general have pretty solid character designs.

I think this show is a must-watch not because it's necessarily ground-breaking, but is a very competently written and produced cute girl show in almost every area, and those of us that like that kind of show will definitely enjoy *Asteroid*.”

(English Title: *In/Spectre*)
![](https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1517/104785l.jpg)
#### Banjo’s Perspective

***Consider It***

Youkai are the otherworldly beings that beget reverence or peril depending on their alignment. For Kotoko Iwanaga and Kurou Sakuragawa, two seemingly normal people intimately connected to youkai, these beings require their wisdom and their strength (respectively). And for *Kyokou Suiri* as a whole, these swirling dynamics lead to a peculiar story.

Two key elements form the core of this show: Kotoko herself and the infused comedy. Kotoko more or less carries the project. Her rapport with Kurou is fun, her characterization is off-kilter, and her forwardness keeps it all moving. As for the comedy, it upholds the tricky business of coexisting with the drama without ruining it. That’s not an easy feat, so it should be praised to some extent.

Beyond these two elements, the rest is mixed. Huge amounts of dialogue are not necessarily a negative, and the exchanges here are by no means laborious. However, it’s a decidedly uneventful task as they (most often Kotoko) just sit down and explain ad nauseum without there being much to care about. Furthermore, the youkai backdrop has been uninteresting, too, and the art, while solid, really only has the character designs going for it.

Thus, the current inspection stays nominal.

#### Another Perspective, courtesy of /u/Groenboys:

***Watch It***

“An anime can have many strengths. Production values, characters, directing, story, but Kyouko Suiri strengths lies in the thing that isn't noticeable right away but is as essential as any other aspect of an anime: the dialogue.

The characters in the anime are witty, thus the dialogue is witty, but it isn't witty in loud and overwhelming sense. All the remarks are evenly spread out throughout an episode so that the dialogue continues to feel fresh. But the biggest reason why the dialogue is so superb is how everything flows so well. Characters talk for minutes on end but it never gets stale or annoying because of how well their sentences flow. The pace of how the words are spoken is soothing. The banter between the characters, how much they respond to one another and how much information is actually being said is juuuuuust right. I have found myself watching episodes only to hear the ED and going like ‘wait, the episode is already over?’ and that is not a bad thing at all.

The reason why I gave this anime a ''Watch It'' and not a ''Must Watch It'' is because 1. the story is good now but I can't say much for later and 2. The anime is very dialogue heavy, so even if the dialogue is great if you like more action in an anime I recommend not checking this out.

For everyone else, if you like mysteries and witty characters, absolutely check this anime out.”

## [**Nekopara**](https://myanimelist.net/anime/38924/Nekopara)
![](https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1716/104880l.jpg)
#### Banjo’s Perspective

***Consider It***

In *Nekopara*, cats are no longer four-legged pets with fur all over their bodies. Rather, they are basically humans with fluffy ears and expressive tails that simply take on the mannerisms of their feline counterparts. And for Chocolo, Vanilla, and the other cat girls, their daily lives are simplistic enough to have few worries, save for a recent development.

Per their catlike nature, the anime brands itself as a slice-of-life project with cuteness as its mainstay. The “cats” will climb along buildings, drool at the sight of fish, and chase after inanimate objects. All the while, their cute behavior emerges as they handle regular human activities, work at the confectionary of their household, and bounce their personalities off each other in distinct pairings.

Artistically, the designs for the cat girls are varied and fit the motifs of the anime, but the remainder of its visual acumen is passable at best. Thematically, the anime isn’t very concerned with delivering a message. Narratively, the small subplot tries its paw at world building but lacks the interest to make it meaningful.

So, characteristically, the anime elicits smiles no doubt, yet whether this shtick uses up its nine lives before the end has become a dire possibility.

#### Another Perspective, courtesy of /u/alwayslonesome:

***Consider It***

“Ahem… do you know about moe anime? Cute girls and their adorable antics, fluffy atmosphere and expressive animation, all attached to a weekly broadcast of the utmost charm… Do you like shows like that? If so, consider checking out Nekopara! The cutest nekos you’ve ever seen await you there~

Set in a world where sapient catgirls are commonplace, Nekopara’s story loosely follows Minazuki Kashou’s opening of his bakery La Soleil. However, any plot is entirely marginalized in favour of foregrounding the antics of the Minazuki family’s nekos – the moemoe “good stuff” we’re all here for. The ensemble of catgirls includes lovable idiot Chocola, deadpan snarker Vanilla, closet-pervert Cinnamon, among others – archetypes that nobody hasn’t seen before, but still do a respectable job of bouncing off of each other and creating light-hearted comedy. The show’s appeal is greatly enhanced by the good job it does transferring the nekos’ lavishly detailed visual novel designs into animation, with plenty of perky nekomimi and expressive tail wags. For those skeptical of the property’s origins, the TV anime is remarkably ecchi-free and family-friendly, trading off cutting-edge chest-bounciness customization for all-ages wholesomeness.

All in all, Nekopara is not a project that’s especially ambitious or exciting, but it successfully capitalizes on the appeal of its source material and does its job as a moe anime very competently. If you are interested in a show that’s fluffier than a catgirl’s ears but doesn’t do much else besides, then joining Kashou and furrends at La Soleil would be a purrfect choice.”

![](https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1399/94794l.jpg)
#### Banjo’s Perspective

***Drop It***

The psychology of the mind is simultaneously a beautiful and terrifying field. Doubly so for the men of *Pet* who dive into this dichotomy to manipulate their hapless victims. Hiroki and Tsukasa are two such individuals that do the diving, and, while the anime would like the audience to believe its capabilities, this mess is not very promising.

So much of the show is already either misplaced or wrong. The production values, from the consistency of the art to the voice acting, are subpar. The characters desperately wish to be backed by mature writing but come off as ridiculous. And the horror elements do not have a strong enough punch to influence the viewer.

If that weren’t bad enough, the anime gets worse. Unnecessary convolution in the storytelling, uninteresting drama, and low entertainment opportunities in general compound the present mess into a catastrophe. There’s almost nothing worth praising in this project, no matter how many “peaks” or “valleys” this pet visits.

#### Another Perspective, courtesy of /u/throwaway_zuk:

***Watch It***

“Pet is a psychological show, about people with powers to get into other's minds and alter memories. While this has been played out in various shows to different degrees, Pet manages to drive home the feeling of how scary this would actually be, and how it can be exploited.

What this show excels in, is the structure it establishes to 'memories', and the rules for 'altering' them, which the characters strictly abide by. This results in clear boundaries of what they can and can't do, with consequences for their actions, as opposed to pulling rabbits out of the hat.

As a viewer, we aren't provided with all the details at the start; in fact, we are thrown right into the mix with a confusing first episode. However, as the show goes on, we learn more about the world and the main cast, with enough questions in our mind to keep us intrigued, while also not leaving us confused.

The cast features strong characters with unique personalities, whose motives and relationships we slowly learn more about. Technically, the show is solid, with notably crisp animations and sound direction, turning the quality up in key scenes. The OP by TK, and the ED (by Memai SIREN, prod. by TK) are exquisite, living up to his reputation.

To summarize, I recommend watching this show for the unique world-building and visualization on the premise of 'altering memories', strong cast, and a mystery which slowly unravels the bigger picture.”

#### Banjo’s Perspective

***Must Watch It***

Ayame Himuro and Shinya Yukimura are scientists dedicated to their craft. But an unforeseen metaphysical variable has entered the equation: love. As scientists, they conclude that the only “true” solution to deciphering their feelings stems from experimentation, with *RikeKoi* chronicling their scientific venture.

Purely a rom-com, this anime has been filled with romance and comedy aplenty. Their different hypotheses lead to heart skips, hilarity, and huge amounts of enjoyment as the two lovebirds realize their connection among the misguided ideas. Better yet, the college setting enwraps the project in a refreshing sense of maturity, and the theme on what exactly *is* love receives two thumbs-up. And the supporting cast – the regular lady, the love “guru”, the woman who stirs the pot – round out the group and supply their own romantic and comedic edge for increased fun.

The artistry isn’t the most spectacular around, but its changes to match for laughs or for emotions are duly noted. And yes, perhaps their formulations are not *perfect* science per se, but it’s science-y enough (with or without the bear-professor education) to don those touted lab coats.

All in all, this lovely project has proven itself from the get-go.

***Consider It***

“Remember Steins;Gate? Of course you do, change of question: Remember the early part of Steins;Gate? The part before all that plot bruhaha, where the most exciting thing you got was Okabe and Kurisu banter, in which you decided those two were the best ship ever?

Well, here's an anime that is basically that, but in explicit and sadly also in worse.

The main premise of Rikei is easily explained: A male and a female scientist like each other very much, but having never watched educational television as a child, never learned to understand their own emotions. As such, once the topic arises, they go full-on Hollywood scientist and seek to prove their mutual love in all kind of scientific and mathematical ways. All this is commented on by another scientist, the audience surrogate/straight man/best girl, who actually is a normal human being and therefore able to show how even in-universe, the main couple‘s behaviour is not normal. Now, on paper, this all sounds very nice, but it quickly runs into trouble: The characters, officially highly-educated scientists, too often behave like total idiots in topics they should understand, asking questions they should know the answer too and taking too long to come up with an obvious solutions. Also, the science often feel much more arm chairy than if it was written by an actual scientist.

In short, this is a must-watch for romance lovers, but everyone less into romance, or maybe even interested due to the S;G parallels, should prepare to groan way too often.”

***Consider It***

The medium of anime covers a wide range of topics, and *Runway de Waratte* walks onto this spectrum by highlighting a topic that is foreign to much of the population: professional fashion. Chiyuki Fujito is an aspiring model, Ikuta Tsumura is an aspiring designer, and the two together seek to become the stars they know they can be.

On the one hand, the anime has created an interesting project. The fashion premise, as denoted above, already acts as a lure for the viewer, but its steps to curate themes on adversity help with its writing basis. Hardships faced, perseverance needed. Common threads that the main characters struggle with in their tough jobs. Speaking of, Chiyuki and Ikuta are a nice duo, two sides of the same coin that have their own parts to play yet whose intertwined stories strike a solid balance.

On the other hand, the project showcases some cracks. Parts of the drama can feel overblown when harsh actions and loud reactions interfere with the overall seriousness of the story at hand. Oddly as well, the music direction, selections, and timings are often overbearing, clouding its scenes with more sound to enact emotional effect at the cost of audience distraction.

But with a clear runway to follow and primed arcs to unfold, this one may very well be smiling come the season’s end.

***Must Watch It***

“In a season that has everything from beloved sequels to a VRMMO CGDCT and to the tales of a wish-granting toilet ghost, a seemingly boring show with runway modeling as the theme was bound to fly under most people's radar. And unjustifiably so - taking Smile on the Runway's more intense moments into account, it should be able to hold its own against battle shounens when it comes to keeping you glued to the screen.

The show follows the journey of Tsumura, an aspiring clothes designer, and Chiyuki, an aspiring runway model, both of whom could never go past the "aspiring" stage until they met each other due to life's circumstances - Tsumura has to choose supporting his large family over getting into designer school, while Chiyuki is half a head shorter than the acceptable height for professional models.

Overall, Smile on the Runway looks like it's shaping up to be a nicely balanced slice of life drama with a basic but well-executed premise, more than passable technical aspects, and last but definitely not least for this kind of show - great characters. If you think your seasonal roster could use another slice of life show, then I highly recommend giving it a shot.”

***Must Watch It***

In a fictious land teeming with a multitude of environments and strange creatures, Golem is an ancient, sentient robot who oversees his esoteric forest. One day, he spots not a bunny or a wolf but instead a human child named Somali, seemingly abandoned and without hope. Humans no longer exist in this land, so Golem takes it upon himself to find them, to bring Somali back home, beginning the amazing journey of *Somali to Mori no Kamisama*

Each aspect of this project has been nothing less than great thus far. The touching story of this “father” and “daughter” evokes themes of family, time, and life. Beautiful artistry paints the landscapes with deft skill and gorgeous detail. Golem and Somali are sound characters insofar as Golem learns about emotions and Somali grows up from the world around her. Fantastic music allows the weight of the scenes to shine. And the adorableness, the wholesomeness, and the sincerity throughout grant leagues of enjoyment.

In total, the spirit and the execution of this anime is as grand as it can be right now, making this show absolutely one of the best of the best this season.

***Watch It***

"Somali to Mori no Kamisama is a quaint Iyashikei show that centers on Somali, a human child who lives in a fantastical society where humans have been mostly wiped out or are sought after as meals, and Golem, her unlikely father figure.

If I could pinpoint the two things that make the show interesting, its that Somali is as cute as they come and her relationship with Golem is unique and heart-warming. Three episodes in and the show hasn't failed to capitalise on Somali’s fascination with the eccentricity of every settlement they visit, often leading to misadventures. Somali is cute in most scenes she’s in and dazzles the audience with her boundless curiosity and adoration of her father figure, which makes way for some unique father-daughter scenes that’s just interesting to see, to say the least. While they could have made Somali just a kid who only chases things, throws a fit and does nothing else and be done with it, we instead get a child who loves to support her father and tries to help him, as we watch her father fumble bluntly in his effort to care for Somali. This dynamic is honestly one of the selling points of the show, and if you like seeing the charming (mis)adventures of a curious father daughter duo with a relaxing fantastical setting as a background, Somali to Mori no Kamisama is the show for you.”
